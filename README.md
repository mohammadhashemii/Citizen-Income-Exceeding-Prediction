# Citizen Income Exceeding Prediction using SVM/KNN
This project was the assignment of the Computational Intelligence course at Shahid Beheshti University. The aim of the project was to take advatage of the SVM(using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)) and KNN(from scratch and without other external libraries) in order to predict the income of the citizens whether they exceed from some constant number or not.


# Dataset

![](https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/Citizen-Income-Exceeding-Prediction/blob/master/data-description.png)

The dataset has been obtained from [KEEL](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=192#sub1). The Adult data set was extracted in 1994 from census data of the United States. It contains continuous and nominal attributes, describing some social information (age, race, sex, marital status, ...) about the citizens registered.training neural networks in PyTorch)


# In a Nutshell   
In a nutshell here's how to use this template, so **for example** assume you want to implement ResNet-18 to train mnist, so you should do the following:
- In `modeling`  folder create a python file named whatever you like, here we named it `example_model.py` . In `modeling/__init__.py` file, you can build a function named `build_model` to call your model

```python
from .example_model import ResNet18

def build_model(cfg):
    model = ResNet18(cfg.MODEL.NUM_CLASSES)
    return model
``` 

   
- In `engine`  folder create a model trainer function and inference function. In trainer function, you need to write the logic of the training process, you can use some third-party library to decrease the repeated stuff.

```python
# trainer
def do_train(cfg, model, train_loader, val_loader, optimizer, scheduler, loss_fn):
 """
 implement the logic of epoch:
 -loop on the number of iterations in the config and call the train step
 -add any summaries you want using the summary
 """
pass

# inference
def inference(cfg, model, val_loader):
"""
implement the logic of the train step
- run the tensorflow session
- return any metrics you need to summarize
 """
pass
```

- In `tools`  folder, you create the `train.py` .  In this file, you need to get the instances of the following objects "Model",  "DataLoader”, “Optimizer”, and config
```python
# create instance of the model you want
model = build_model(cfg)

# create your data generator
train_loader = make_data_loader(cfg, is_train=True)
val_loader = make_data_loader(cfg, is_train=False)

# create your model optimizer
optimizer = make_optimizer(cfg, model)
```

- Pass the all these objects to the function `do_train` , and start your training
```python
# here you train your model
do_train(cfg, model, train_loader, val_loader, optimizer, None, F.cross_entropy)
```

**You will find a template file and a simple example in the model and trainer folder that shows you how to try your first model simply.**
